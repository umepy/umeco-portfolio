  BIOGRAPHY:
    "I have been interested in machine learning since my second year of undergraduate school. I joined the laboratory of Professor Hidetoshi Urawa as a lab worker. As a laboratory assistant, I participated in data analysis competitions and research conferences to deepen my understanding of machine learning. In my fourth year of undergraduate school, I won the top prize in a data analysis competition and conducted research on alternative foods. In graduate school, I researched a learning method that applies embedded models to the reinforcement learning field.",
